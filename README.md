This is a Food Bank app that was created using Java and Swing, this app allows users to determine what particular items they should get every week based on a couple of parameters such as information about the users family, how many people are in there family and also information for each individual in the family such as their gender, age, height, and weight. The user can also optionally select if particular members are on a diet such as sports diet or weight loss diet. These inputs are configured by the user using a GUI that was created using Java Swing. The app then goes through a SQL database which has all food items, which was retrieved from the Canada Food Guide and determines a basket/hamper and displays this basket/hamper to the user. 

The technolgies that we used in this app was Java, Java Swing, JUnit, and SQL. As well as we used several Object-Oriented Principles such as inheritance of class, aggregation and composiotn, and creating interfaces.
